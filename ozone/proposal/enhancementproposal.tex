\textbf{Selected Visualization:} \href{https://sureshlodha.github.io/CMPS165_Winter15_FinalProjects/OzoneInTheAir/}{Asthma and the Ozone}\\

Firstly, this visualization is in V3, I plan to bring it up to V5. The biggest weakness this visualization has is that
it runs slowly after pressing buttons a few times. Every time a button is pressed, the paths that were generated
aren't updated, they are instead ignored and new paths are generated on top of the old ones. This means that
there are more and more path elements after each button press. This causes the visualization to be slow. If 
someone were to use it, they'd have to refresh the page after around 6 or 7 button presses. I plan on fixing this
as well. There's also some AQI data missing in this visualization. So I plan on gathering that from this website I 
found that does have \href{https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-quality-index-report}{it}. I also plan on 
updating it to include years 2000 to 2019. I will remove the buttons and replace it with a slider to select the year.
This last change is only cosmetic. If also plan on getting data for COPD for all years 2000-2018, not just 2014 as
this visualization does.
